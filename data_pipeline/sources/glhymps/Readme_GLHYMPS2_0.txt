********Columns in shapefile******************************

*Indicates column can’t be deleted as it is locked.
OBJECTID_1* - Master identifier for each polygon
SHAPE* - No value. Polygon listed in every row.
IDENTITY_ - Original file name of polygon from original data source (ex. CHN33507) [data derived from GLHYMPS]
logK_Ice_x100_INT – Near surface global permeability values including permafrost areas (ex. logk = -2000). Values multiplied by 100 to become an integer. (This is the data to use if you want best representation of current global permeability with permafrost) In units m2
logK_Ferr_x100_INT – Near surface global permeability values including permafrost areas (ex. logk = -1090). Values multiplied by 100 to become an integer. (This is the data to use if you want best representation of current global permeability without permafrost) In units m2

********HOW TO CONVERT logk********************************

In the paper we show log(k) or log permeability (Figure 3). What we distribute is log(k)*100 or log permeability*100 so that it is an integer. Therefore k = 10^(k/100)

From some purposes, hydraulic conductivity is more useful. In the following, be careful of difference between little k (permeabilty) and big K (hydraulic conductivity).

K = k*rho*g/mu

Where K (m/s) is hydraulic conductivity which is dependent on fluid viscosity and density
rho (kg/m3) is the density of the fluid, normally water = 999.97 kg/m3
g (m/s2) is the acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s2
mu (kg/m.s or Pa.s) is the viscosity of the fluid, normally water = 1e-3

Therefore, to convert permeability (m2) into hydaulic conductivity (m/s):

K = k*1e+7

Or if you want the full conversion of the mapped value: K = 10^(k/100)*1e+7
If you want to assume a 100 m thick aquifer, the transmissivity is therefore:
T = 10^(COLUMN/100)*1e+7*THICKNESS
 10^(k/100)*1e+7*100
